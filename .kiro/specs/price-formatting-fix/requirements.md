# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical price formatting bug in the EggyPro ecommerce store where the application crashes with "toFixed is not a function" errors. The issue occurs because prices are stored as strings in some parts of the system but the code attempts to use number methods like `toFixed()` on them, causing runtime errors that break cart functionality, checkout processes, and product displays.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view product prices correctly formatted without application crashes, so that I can see pricing information and make purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product price is displayed THEN the system SHALL format it as a currency string without runtime errors
2. WHEN prices are stored as strings in the database THEN the system SHALL convert them to numbers before applying formatting methods
3. WHEN price formatting fails THEN the system SHALL display a fallback price format instead of crashing
4. IF a price value is null or undefined THEN the system SHALL display a default price indicator
5. WHEN multiple products are displayed THEN all prices SHALL be consistently formatted across the interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to add products to my cart and see accurate total calculations, so that I know the correct amount I will be charged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN items are added to the cart THEN the system SHALL calculate totals using numeric price values
2. WHEN cart totals are displayed THEN the system SHALL format them as currency without errors
3. WHEN cart quantities change THEN the system SHALL recalculate totals correctly using proper number operations
4. IF price conversion fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback pricing to prevent cart functionality from breaking
5. WHEN cart is empty THEN the system SHALL display a properly formatted zero total

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to proceed through checkout with accurate pricing, so that I can complete my purchase successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checkout page loads THEN all price displays SHALL be properly formatted without runtime errors
2. WHEN payment calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL use numeric price values for accuracy
3. WHEN order totals are calculated THEN the system SHALL handle price type conversion seamlessly
4. IF any price formatting fails during checkout THEN the system SHALL prevent order submission and display an error
5. WHEN order confirmation is displayed THEN all prices SHALL be consistently formatted

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want consistent price handling throughout the codebase, so that price-related bugs are prevented and the system is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prices are processed THEN the system SHALL use a centralized utility function for formatting
2. WHEN price data is received from APIs THEN the system SHALL validate and convert types consistently
3. WHEN new components handle prices THEN they SHALL use the standardized price formatting approach
4. IF price type inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings for debugging
5. WHEN price calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety throughout the operation
