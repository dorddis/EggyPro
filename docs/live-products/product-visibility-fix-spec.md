# Product Visibility Fix & Navigation Enhancement Specification

## Overview

This specification addresses the critical issues preventing products from displaying in the EggyPro store and implements navigation improvements to create a complete ecommerce experience.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **API Failure (Critical)**
- **Issue**: `/api/products` endpoint returning 500 error
- **Root Cause**: Likely database connection or query execution issues
- **Impact**: No products visible on homepage or throughout the site

### 2. **Navigation Structure (Enhancement)**
- **Issue**: Navigation shows "Product" (singular) linking to a specific product
- **Requirement**: Change to "Products" (plural) and create a dedicated products catalog page
- **Impact**: Users cannot browse the full product catalog

### 3. **Product Display Limitations (Enhancement)**
- **Issue**: Homepage only shows 2 featured products
- **Requirement**: Create a comprehensive products page showing all 12 products
- **Impact**: Limited product discovery and poor ecommerce experience

## Implementation Requirements

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoints Required

#### Products API
- `GET /api/products` - List all products with filtering
- `GET /api/products/search` - Search products (already implemented)
- `GET /api/products/[slug]` - Get single product
- `GET /api/products/stats` - Product statistics (already implemented)

#### Search Parameters
```typescript
interface ProductSearchParams {
  q?: string;           // Search query
  minPrice?: number;    // Minimum price filter
  maxPrice?: number;    // Maximum price filter
  inStock?: boolean;    // Stock availability filter
  sort?: 'price-asc' | 'price-desc' | 'name-asc' | 'newest';
  page?: number;        // Pagination
  limit?: number;       // Items per page
}
```

### Component Architecture

#### Products Page Structure
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Must Fix)
1. **API Error Resolution** - Critical for basic functionality
2. **Products Page Creation** - Core ecommerce requirement
3. **Navigation Update** - Basic UX improvement

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
4. **Search and Filters** - Enhanced product discovery
5. **Homepage Enhancement** - Better product showcase
6. **Error Handling** - Professional user experience

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
7. **Performance Optimization** - Enhanced performance
8. **Advanced Features** - Pagination, advanced filters

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Database Connection Issues**: May require environment configuration fixes
- **TypeScript Compatibility**: Type mismatches between API and frontend
- **Performance Impact**: Large product catalogs may slow page loads

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all API endpoints before frontend integration
