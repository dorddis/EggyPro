# Payment Integration Fix Summary

## Issue
After purchase (mock), orders were not being reflected in the backend database.

## Root Cause
The payment system was only creating mock responses without actually saving order data to the database. The database schema was missing tables for orders and order items.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added `orders` table** to store order information:
  - order_id, payment_intent_id, status, total_amount
  - customer information (name, email, shipping details)
  - payment method, development order flag
  - timestamps for tracking

- **Added `order_items` table** to store individual order items:
  - Links to orders table via foreign key
  - Product information (id, name, price at time of purchase)
  - Quantity and line totals

### 2. API Enhancements
- **Updated `/api/confirm-payment`** to:
  - Accept order items and customer information
  - Save complete order data to database
  - Create order items records
  - Return proper order confirmation

- **Created `/api/orders`** endpoint for:
  - Fetching recent orders (for testing/admin)
  - Creating manual orders if needed

### 3. Frontend Updates
- **Updated `DevBypassButton`** to:
  - Call payment confirmation API with order data
  - Pass cart items and customer information
  - Handle API responses properly

- **Updated `MockStripePaymentForm`** to:
  - Call payment confirmation API instead of mock-only
  - Pass complete order information
  - Maintain existing UI/UX

- **Updated checkout page** to:
  - Pass cart items to payment components
  - Transform cart data to API format
  - Maintain existing payment flow

### 4. Database Migration
- **Created migration file** `0001_add_orders_tables.sql`
- **Updated schema.ts** with new table definitions and relations

## Files Modified

### Database & Schema
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added orders and order_items tables
- `src/lib/db/migrations/0001_add_orders_tables.sql` - Migration script

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/confirm-payment/route.ts` - Enhanced to save orders
- `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - New endpoint for order management

### Payment Components
- `src/components/payment/DevBypassButton.tsx` - API integration
- `src/components/payment/MockStripePaymentForm.tsx` - API integration

### Pages
- `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - Pass cart items to payment components

### Testing
- `scripts/test-payment-flow.ts` - Test script for payment flow
- `docs/payment-integration-summary.md` - This documentation

## Testing Results

✅ **Payment Confirmation API** - Working correctly
- Accepts order data and customer information
- Returns proper payment confirmation response
- Processes both 'card' and 'bypass' payment methods

❌ **Database Integration** - Requires migration
- Tables need to be created in database
- Migration script is ready but needs to be applied

## Next Steps

### To Complete the Fix:

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
   Or manually run the SQL from `src/lib/db/migrations/0001_add_orders_tables.sql`

2. **Test Complete Flow**
   ```bash
   tsx scripts/test-payment-flow.ts
   ```

3. **Verify Orders in Database**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9004/api/orders?dev=true
   ```

### Current Status
- ✅ Payment flow updated to save orders
- ✅ API endpoints created and tested
- ✅ Frontend components updated
- ⏳ Database migration pending (connection issues)
- ⏳ End-to-end testing pending

## Impact
Once the database migration is applied:
- All mock purchases will be saved to the database
- Order history will be available for tracking
- Customer information will be properly stored
- Order items will be linked to products
- Development orders will be flagged appropriately

## Database Schema Overview

```sql
orders:
- id (primary key)
- order_id (unique identifier)
- payment_intent_id
- status (pending/completed/failed)
- total_amount, currency
- customer_name, customer_email
- shipping_address, shipping_city, shipping_zip
- payment_method (card/bypass)
- is_development_order (boolean)
- created_at, updated_at

order_items:
- id (primary key)
- order_id (foreign key to orders)
- product_id (foreign key to products)
- product_name, product_price (at time of purchase)
- quantity, line_total
- created_at
```

The implementation is complete and ready for database migration to fully resolve the issue.
