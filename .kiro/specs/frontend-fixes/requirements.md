# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical frontend issues in the EggyPro ecommerce store that are preventing users from accessing product pages, searching for products, and viewing admin statistics. The current implementation has three major API endpoints failing with 404 and 500 errors, which severely impacts the user experience and store functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view individual product details by clicking on a product, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/product/[slug]` THEN the system SHALL display the complete product information without 404 errors
2. WHEN a product page loads THEN the system SHALL display product name, description, price, stock status, and reviews
3. WHEN a product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the stock status to the user
4. IF a product slug does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a proper 404 page with navigation options
5. WHEN a product page loads THEN the system SHALL display related products to encourage additional purchases

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to search for products using text queries and filters, so that I can quickly find products that match my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a search query THEN the system SHALL return relevant products without 500 errors
2. WHEN a user applies price filters THEN the system SHALL return products within the specified price range
3. WHEN a user filters by stock availability THEN the system SHALL return only products matching the stock criteria
4. WHEN a user applies multiple filters simultaneously THEN the system SHALL return products matching all criteria
5. WHEN a user sorts search results THEN the system SHALL order products according to the selected sorting option
6. IF a search query returns no results THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message with suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to view comprehensive store statistics, so that I can monitor business performance and inventory levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display total product count without 500 errors
2. WHEN the stats API is called THEN the system SHALL return total stock quantity across all products
3. WHEN the stats API is called THEN the system SHALL return total number of reviews and average rating
4. WHEN the stats API is called THEN the system SHALL identify and list products with low stock levels
5. WHEN the stats API is called THEN the system SHALL provide summary counts for in-stock, out-of-stock, and low-stock products
6. IF any individual stat calculation fails THEN the system SHALL return fallback values to prevent complete failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want to see appropriate loading states and error messages, so that I understand what's happening when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN an API request fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN a page is loading THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shifts with skeleton components
4. IF a critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options or navigation alternatives
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL capture sufficient detail for debugging without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want robust error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN Supabase queries fail THEN the system SHALL capture and log the specific error details
3. WHEN client-side errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement error boundaries to prevent application crashes
4. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include consistent error response formats
5. IF database queries fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms where appropriate
