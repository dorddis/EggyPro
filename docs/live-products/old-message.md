Of course. Implementing a proper backend and database is a     
  great step forward for your application. Breaking down the     
  requirements into separate specification files is an
  excellent way to organize the work.

  Based on your request, here is an outline of the spec
  files I suggest we create inside the docs/ directory to        
  plan the database and API implementation thoroughly:

   1. `database-schema-spec.md`: This will be the blueprint
      for our database. It will define the Product table with
      all necessary columns like id, name, description, price,
       quantity, images, category, slug, etc. We can also
      define a Reviews table and specify how it links to the
      products.

   2. `api-endpoints-spec.md`: This will specify the API
      routes (Route Handlers in Next.js) that our application
      will use to communicate with the database. For example,
      we'll define endpoints like GET /api/products to fetch
      all products and GET /api/products/[slug] to fetch a
      single product by its slug.

   3. `backend-architecture-spec.md`: This document will
      outline our technology choices and setup. I recommend
      we specify using Vercel Postgres for the database and
      Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries. This file
      will also cover how to manage database connections and
      environment variables securely within the Next.js
      project.

   4. `data-seeding-spec.md`: To get our application running
      with product data, this spec will describe how to
      populate (or "seed") the database with initial data.
      This will include a script or instructions for adding a
      few sample products.

   5. `frontend-integration-spec.md`: This will be the plan
      for connecting our frontend components to the new
      backend API. It will identify which components (like
      product pages and cards) need to be updated to fetch
      live data from the database instead of using the
      current mock data.

  This set of documents will give us a clear and
  comprehensive plan for building a robust backend for your      
  e-commerce store.
