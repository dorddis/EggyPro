# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses all build and lint errors found in the codebase to ensure code quality, consistency, and adherence to React/Next.js best practices before merging with the main branch. The issues include ESLint errors, TypeScript compilation warnings, unescaped entities, unused variables, improper type usage, and build warnings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint errors to be fixed so that the codebase maintains high quality standards and passes linting checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL return zero errors
2. WHEN checking React components THEN the system SHALL properly escape all HTML entities (quotes and apostrophes)
3. WHEN using navigation links THEN the system SHALL use Next.js Link component instead of anchor tags for internal navigation
4. WHEN declaring variables THEN the system SHALL use `const` instead of `let` for variables that are never reassigned

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variables and imports to be removed so that the code is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL only import what is actually used
2. WHEN declaring variables THEN the system SHALL remove or use all declared variables
3. WHEN defining function parameters THEN the system SHALL use all parameters or prefix unused ones with underscore

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript typing so that type safety is maintained throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining function parameters THEN the system SHALL use specific types instead of `any`
2. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use proper error types
3. WHEN working with API responses THEN the system SHALL define proper interface types
4. WHEN logging data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate parameter types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete without errors or warnings so that the application can be deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without errors
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL resolve all TypeScript compilation issues
3. WHEN processing dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle all webpack warnings appropriately
4. WHEN generating static content THEN the system SHALL complete without blocking errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be ready for merging with the main branch so that deployment can proceed smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL pass both lint and build checks
2. WHEN merging with main branch THEN the system SHALL not introduce any regressions
3. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL function correctly in production
4. WHEN running automated checks THEN the system SHALL meet all quality gates
