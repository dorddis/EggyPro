# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses card height consistency issues across the EggyPro application. Currently, product cards on the products page and feature cards on the main page have inconsistent heights due to varying text content lengths, creating an uneven and unprofessional appearance. This spec will ensure all cards in grid layouts maintain consistent heights for a polished, professional look.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing products, I want all product cards to have consistent heights so that the product grid looks professional and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the products page THEN all product cards SHALL have equal heights regardless of description length
2. WHEN product descriptions vary in length THEN cards SHALL maintain consistent visual alignment
3. WHEN hovering over product cards THEN the hover effects SHALL work consistently across all cards
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN card height consistency SHALL be maintained across all responsive breakpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the homepage, I want the "Why Choose EggyPro?" feature cards to have consistent heights so that the section looks balanced and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the homepage "Why Choose EggyPro?" section THEN all three feature cards SHALL have equal heights
2. WHEN feature card descriptions vary in length THEN cards SHALL maintain visual balance
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN cards SHALL stack properly while maintaining consistent heights within each row
4. WHEN cards contain different amounts of text THEN the layout SHALL remain visually appealing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing testimonials, I want testimonial cards to have consistent heights so that the testimonials section appears organized and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing testimonial cards THEN all cards in the same row SHALL have equal heights
2. WHEN testimonials have varying comment lengths THEN cards SHALL maintain consistent alignment
3. WHEN some testimonials have images and others don't THEN height consistency SHALL still be maintained
4. WHEN viewing testimonials on different devices THEN responsive behavior SHALL preserve height consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a reusable solution for card height consistency so that future card components automatically maintain proper alignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new card components THEN developers SHALL have access to consistent height utilities
2. WHEN existing cards are modified THEN height consistency SHALL be preserved automatically
3. WHEN new card types are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with the height consistency system
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN the height consistency implementation SHALL be clear and maintainable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want card height consistency to not interfere with screen readers and keyboard navigation so that the site remains fully accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN card content SHALL remain properly structured and readable
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN focus states SHALL work correctly on all cards
3. WHEN cards have consistent heights THEN accessibility features SHALL not be compromised
4. WHEN content is dynamically loaded THEN accessibility attributes SHALL remain intact
